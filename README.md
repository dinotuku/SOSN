# A brief history of programming

# Abstract OLD
For most people doing coding today, Stack Overflow should not be an unfamiliar site. It is being used by thousands and potentially millions of people from all over the world each day to find solutions to problems, and in some sense it acts like a miniature version of the programming community. The main idea behind our project is indeed that it would be very interesting to try to generalize trends and behaviors on Stack Overflow to gain some insights into the wider community of programming in the world. In particular, the usage of different programming languages and the types of questions and answers they get are good resources that could help us find out interesting patterns. In the project, we are going to analyze the users, posts and comments data, as well as the annual developer survey from Stack Overflow, hoping to understand how the community weâ€™re all a part of has evolved over the years. 

# Abstract NEW
For most people doing coding today, Stack Overflow should not be an unfamiliar site. It is being used by thousands and potentially millions of people from all over the world each day to find solutions to problems. The main idea of our project is that it would be interesting to see what are the users of Stackoverflow really like and how are they distributed around the world? Which countries contribute the most to the site, and in which ways? The information could be very interesting to Stackoverflow itself, since it would allow them to understand the users potential areas for growth. Since Stackoverflow is such a large and widely used site for help in programming, it is also interesting in a wider perspective since the results could reflect something about how the programming community works as a whole. 

# Research questions
* Statistical data exploration on Stack Overflow
* How many users / posts are there?
* What is the distribution of tags?
* How has the demographics of Stack Overflow changed over time?
* How has the popularity of different programming languages changed over time, and what are the potential reasons driving the trend?
* Are questions or answers with positive sentiment getting answered or picked more frequently? Is there a relationship between quality and sentiment?
* What are the characteristics of questions that get downvoted a lot?

# Research questions NEW
* How are the users distributed geographically? Which countries have the highest amount of users per-capita?
* What are the users like? E.g. how old are they, what are their salaries and how do these things correlate with each other and the home country of the user?
* How is the activity on the website distributed? In what countries are the users most active at asking questions and where are they most active at answering them? Are there countries where the users go to the site often but don't contribute that much? Do there exist patterns of questions asked in some countries being often answered in others?
* What are the factors that drive these effects, and what could be done to change them? For instance, the general English proficiency of the country will likely have an effect on the activity and amount of users.


# Dataset
* **Google BigQuery Stack Overflow.**
The dataset is hosted in Google BigQuery and we get 1TB of free BigQuery processing every month which means we can get 1TB of data per month. There are data of users, posts, comments, tags, votes, and badges from 2008 to 2019. We can use SQL query to get the data we want and use the download feature to save it as CSV or JSON file.
Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey
* **Stack Overflow host surveys from 2011 to 2019.** 
They ask questions like Do you code as a hobby, Are you currently enrolled in a formal, degree-granting college or university program and many other kinds of questions. The respondents were recruited through onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts. According to the documentation, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it. The dataset is in CSV format and about 50 - 200MB per year.

Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey
* **Stack Overflow host surveys from 2016 to 2019.** 
They ask questions like Do you code as a hobby, Are you currently enrolled in a formal, degree-granting college or university program and many other kinds of questions. The respondents were recruited through onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts. According to the documentation, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it. The dataset is in CSV format and about 50 - 200MB per year.
* **World Bank Open Data/UN Data/Kaggle. **
We are also going to use datasets that have information on the mean years of schooling, GDP per capita, population and number of internet users per country.
